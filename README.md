# WordGenerator-Tensorflow
I found a project on the internet. Written UI for the text generation.

# Requirements of packages
* Tensorflow
* Python3-tk (if on linux)
* numpy

# Steps to generate text
1. Configure the wordlist in textprocessingandtraining.py and launch textprocessingandtraining.py
2. Go into the directory where you cloned/downloaded the zip of this repository and take note of the .hdf5 file that has the lowest loss and put it under the filename variable
3. Launch ui.py and press the button.
4. Have Fun!
