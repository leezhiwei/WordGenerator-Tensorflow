# WordGenerator-Tensorflow
I found a project on the internet. Written UI for the text generation.

# Requirements of packages
* Tensorflow
* Python3-tk (if on linux)
* numpy

# Steps to generate text
1. Configure the wordlist in textprocessingandtraining.py and launch textprocessingandtraining.py
2. Launch ui.py and press the button.
3. Have Fun!

# Source of wordlist
https://www.mit.edu/~ecprice/wordlist.10000

# Some code from
https://machinelearningmastery.com/text-generation-lstm-recurrent-neural-networks-python-keras/

# Help and Contributions
Any help and contributions by anyone is appreciated!

# Features to work on!!
1. Make it so that after running the text processing & training script, you don't have to edit the ui.py to accomodate the HDF5 file. (Done)
